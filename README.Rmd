This is a repository for the tidybiology meetup beginning January 2020. The goals of tidybiology meetups are to continue learning R and to elevate data literacy among biologists. We meet on the last Monday of each month from 4-5pm in the Winn Conference Room at the DMPI in Durham. All are welcome here.
